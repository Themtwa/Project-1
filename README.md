# Project-1

This is going to be a project where we a attempt to build an app that will allow us to achieve the following goals.

1. Show sports scores from different leagues.
2. Show the local real time weather for the event.
3. Show local events or things to do around the sporting event.

This will be a rudimentary application since this is our first time working as a group, we we are all beginning developers still.
